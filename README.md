# quarto-quickstart

This is an example quarto notebook that uses both python and R

## Installation

This setup only works if Python was installed with the `--enable-shared` option. I had to first uninstall python adn then re-install it with the option as shown:

```
env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.11.2
```

# quarto-quickstart

Python + R notebook using Quarto!

Example notebook: http://dhrumilmehta.com/quarto-quickstart/quickstart.html

## Installation

This setup only works if Python was installed with the `--enable-shared` option. I had to first uninstall python adn then re-install it with the `--enable-shared` option. Since I use pyenv, I installed it as follows:

```
env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.11.2
```
